# 3D-Printing-using-Articulated-Robots

## Overview
This repository explores the innovative application of articulated robots, specifically the Yaskawa GP50, in the field of concrete 3D printing. It covers the development of a custom MoveIt package for real-time robot movement during printing, aiming to enhance precision and flexibility in creating complex structures.

## Project Highlights
- **Custom MoveIt Package Development**: Creation of a tailored MoveIt package enabling real-time control and trajectory planning for the Yaskawa GP50 robot.
- **Integration with ROS**: Utilization of the Robot Operating System (ROS) for comprehensive robot management, including movement visualization with Rviz.
- **Advanced Control Features**: Implementation of features allowing for on-the-fly adjustments during printing, ensuring adaptability to real-world conditions.

## Methodology
- Initial setup and movement testing of the Yaskawa GP50 using ROS and Rviz.
- Development of a Python-based custom MoveIt package to facilitate real-time movement and trajectory planning.
- Integration of 3D models for structured printing path generation.

## Validation
- Comparison of robot movement with Rviz simulations to ensure accuracy.
- Analytical and simulated data validation for forward and inverse kinematics, and the Jacobian matrix.

## Future Work
Proposes further research in simulating 3D concrete structure creation, leveraging CAD and simulation tools for enhanced environmental and process simulation.

## Requirements
- ROS
- Python
- MoveIt
- Rviz
